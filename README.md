## Installation

#### For Mac

First install `Xcode Command Line Tools` because node-gyp needs to this.

Alternatively, if you already have the full Xcode installed, you can find them under the menu `Xcode` -> `Open Developer Tool` -> `More Developer Tools....` This step will install clang, clang++, and make.

```
xcode-select --install
```
And then:
```
yarn install
```
